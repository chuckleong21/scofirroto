**The R Oceanus** is a play-on-words coming from [Patrick Burns](https://twitter.com/burnsstat)' work, [_The R Inferno_](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/05/the-r-inferno-revised/): "If you donâ€™t know of it, it is a short explanation of a few trouble spots when using the R language. Somehow the short explanation grew to approach book-length", quoted from the blog post on r-bloggers. One of the challenges when it comes to learning the R programming language is, a person does not know something that is outside one's cognitive constraints, hence useRs often have that moment of "I wish I knew this sooner" for a particular problem whereas that knowledge is already available somewhere. That is also how "_a few trouble spots_" have grown up to the size of a book, like exploring the ocean by yourself but only to find it's never-ending.

The R community has been always cordial not only to newcomers, but to everyone. #rstats on Twitter has gathered many great useRs and surely there will be more. If you start from zero with R, these should be adequate to get you started.

So what does this page of this blog do? I hope to share with you my experience in R programming from package to package, why, of course, one package at a time. There are no doubt some great packages out there that you wish you hear of it sooner, and I hope you will share yours. These following packages/topics are the ones I am following closely:
