**The R Oceanus** is a play-on-words coming from [Patrick Burns](https://twitter.com/burnsstat)' work, [_The R Inferno_](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2011/05/the-r-inferno-revised/): "If you donâ€™t know of it, it is a short explanation of a few trouble spots when using the R language. Somehow the short explanation grew to approach book-length", quoted from the blog post on r-bloggers. One of the challenges when it comes to learning the R programming language is, a person does not know something that is outside one's cognitive constraints, hence useRs often have that moment of "I wish I knew this sooner" for a particular problem whereas that knowledge is already available somewhere. That is also how "_a few trouble spots_" have grown up to the size of a book, like exploring the ocean by yourself but only to find it's never-ending.

The R community has been always cordial not only to newcomers, but to everyone. [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats) on Twitter has gathered many great useRs and surely there will be more. If you start from zero with R and looking for amazing resources, check out the following Twitter thread:

I was looking back at the folks I recommend newbies follow and they&#39;re all dudes.

So what does this page of this blog do? I hope to share with you my experience in R programming from package to package, why, of course, one package at a time. There are no doubt some great packages out there that you wish you hear of it sooner, and I hope you will share yours.

Happy learning!
